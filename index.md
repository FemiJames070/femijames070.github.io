# I design, deploy, and scale AI systems that work in the real world.

I don’t just prototype ideas.  
I build **production-grade, ethical, and scalable AI products** — from system design to deployment and growth.

I operate at the intersection of:
**AI Engineering • Product Architecture • Data-Driven Growth**

## 🚀 Flagship Product — MESS Tracker

**MESS Tracker** is a multi-tenant, AI-powered SaaS platform digitizing waste management operations across Western Canada.

Designed as an **end-to-end operating system**, it replaces fragmented, manual workflows with an intelligent, scalable, and data-driven platform.

### What it delivers
- AI-assisted scheduling & dispatch
- Automated waste classification (Computer Vision)
- Predictive demand & operational risk modeling
- Multi-tenant architecture for B2B2C scale
- Built-in growth intelligence (SEO, GEO, AEO)

## 🧠 Proof of Execution — StrokeRisk AI System

**StrokeRisk** is an end-to-end clinical decision-support system built with a cross-functional team using the **CRISP-DM lifecycle**.

This project demonstrates my ability to collaborate, design responsibly, and deploy AI in sensitive, high-stakes domains.

### System Highlights
- Ensemble machine learning models
- Explainable AI (SHAP-based interpretability)
- Human-centered & ethical AI design
- Model monitoring & post-deployment evaluation
- Team-based system delivery

## 🧩 How I Build Systems

I approach AI as a **product**, not a model.

### My design philosophy
- **Systems before models** — architecture matters
- **Evidence over claims** — show behavior, not hype
- **Human-centered by default** — ethics is not optional
- **Built to scale** — technically and operationally

### Core capabilities
- Full-stack AI engineering (ML + backend + frontend)
- NLP, Computer Vision, and Predictive Modeling
- Cloud deployment, MLOps, and system monitoring
- Product growth architecture (SEO, GEO, AEO)
- Technical storytelling for teams, stakeholders, and investors
